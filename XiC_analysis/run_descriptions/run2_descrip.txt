The first run didn't go exactly as planned. After TMVA had finished (or so I thought)
building the BDT, I checked the output of the script and saw that something went wrong.
After some further inspection it turned out that I had already used all my storage
in my home directory, and the (big) .root files which are used to store the BDT's in
could not be saved. The only file which could be partially saved was the 10 tree run,
but since this one isn't completed it cannot be used for analysis and it isn't really
useful to start with (10 trees is an extreme case to help in determination of overfitting).

After asking Chris about it, I learned that there is a lot more disk space available to
store data in '/data/bfys/mkoopmans'. So I now create all my trees there.

Another issue I didn't take into account was the fact that I used **all** data for both
training and testing, which we for sure don't want (as this will give a far more perfect
view of our BDT than might actually be the case). Taking this into account, I will now
look at a 80/20 split of the data into training/testing sets.

In this run I will apply both changes listed above and see if I can get some results this
time.
