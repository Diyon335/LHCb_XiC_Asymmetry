Increasing the max tree depth from 4 to 5 didn't change anything regarding
the ROC AUC. Now, instead of log-transforming all variables, I thought it
might be wise to exponentiate some variables. I exponentiated all IP_OWNPV
values based on visual inspection. I divided lcplus_TIP and lcplus_FD_OWNPV
with 100 and 1000 respectively, and then I exponentiated them. I also transformed
all ProbNN values, by taking 1 - sqrt(1 - ProbNN), which Emmy Gabriels used
in her research.
