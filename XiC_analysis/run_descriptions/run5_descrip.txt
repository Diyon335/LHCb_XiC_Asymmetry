As mentioned before, the scripts now finally work properly. I analyzed the results of
run 4 and decided that there was some tweaking to be done. The BDT classified the
majority of events correctly, however there was still a relatively large overlap between
the signal and background classifications.

To get rid of this overlap, I tweaked some of the variables. First of all, I removed all
IPCHI2_OWNPV from the daughter particles, as these were not really showing a difference
wether they were signal or background. Secondly, I transformed the variables lcplus_FD_OWNPV,
lcplus_ENDVERTEX_CHI2 and lcplus_IPCHI2_OWNPV using a log transform. I hope this transform
will amplify the differences between the signal and background data. I made these transformations
based on research by Emmy Gabriel, a PhD student at Nikhef who is working on something very similar.
She looks at the decay of XiC_0 to XiC_+ and LambdaC_+, and she also uses a BDT to select signal
over background.

She however transforms all variables, I will not do this (directly). I first want to see if
transforming some of the variables results in a noticeable difference in the quality of the
BDT.
