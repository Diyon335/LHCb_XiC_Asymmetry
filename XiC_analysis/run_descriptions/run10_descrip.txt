After adding the variables from last time, I decided to exclude the TIP's for
all daughter particles and the PVCDTF_CHI2 because they didn't show any separation
between the background and signal data whatsoever. I also log-transformed all other
variables based on the separation they showed. On top of this, Chris mentioned that
it might be wise to also weed out signal data based on mass. So I took only the data
with mass between 2440 MeV and 2490 MeV.
