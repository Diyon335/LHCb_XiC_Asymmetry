The changes made in run 13 increased the ROC AUC a little bit again. Niw I am
curious in which way transforming the variables affects the ROC AUC, so this run
I ran a BDT with all variables I had before, but without any of them being transformed
I can than compare the importance of a variable to its transformed counterpart, and
can thus create the optimal combination of transformed and raw variables.
